# Code for Pricing Calculator

## Description
This project is specific for a calculator built on Webflow. 
Its values and logic are based on Pinata's usage-based pricing model launched in September 2023.
I am using noUiSlider library to initialize 5 different sliders, each with different values, and Javascript to craft the backend logic. This is how final result looked like:
